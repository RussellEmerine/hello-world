# hello-world
My first repository! For testing purposes mainly.
I am Russell Emerine, linguist, mathematician, coder, musician, and metalhead. I am trilingual in English, Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. I am also trilingual in C++, Python, and Haskell, and I've messed around with some other programming languages.
